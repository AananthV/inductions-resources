**Hello Web Devs!**

We’ve put together a list of resources for you to start learning some basics before going on to your tasks. Additionally, you can contact your mentor for any kind of assistance.

## FRONT-END

- To start off on a web page, the most obvious component is **HTML** - Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML defines the structure of your page. All the content in your page goes into HTML tags, which act like containers for your different kinds of text and images.

- Next up, there’s **CSS** - Cascading Style Sheets. CSS helps style your pages. It tells the HTML how to look, move, fit on small screens, and all that pretty stuff.

- **JavaScript** is the third component, and gives the page functionality. JavaScript enables you to modify the HTML through your programs, and so you can create dynamic, and interactive web pages.

- These three main components form the core of Front-End Web development, which is what you will be starting out with. Front-End refers to the part of a website that a user can see, so everything that you code here will happen within your browser.

**Some resources for frontend are listed below:**

- [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) - HTML Reference from MDN (Mozilla Developer Network). MDN is a great resource in general for CSS and JavaScript as well. We recommend MDN over W3Schools, since W3 is not as updated as MDN.
- [https://eloquentjavascript.net/](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) - A very comprehensive book on Javascript that starts from it’s basics and builds up to advanced topics.
- [https://javascript.info/](https://javascript.info/) - An elaborate tutorial from the basic to the more difficult concepts of Javascript.
- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIORjGvT0kk&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gfoKa5la9dsdCNpuey2s-V](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIORjGvT0kk&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gfoKa5la9dsdCNpuey2s-V) - Comprehensive JavaScript DOM Tutorial by "The Net Ninja"
- [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) - More DOM Manipulation from MDN

**For any doubts, refer [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) docs.**

## BACK-END

- Back-End code runs not in your browser, but on a remote server, which is a computer that could be anywhere. The job of the backend is to offer sevices that require data to be stored, processed, and delivered - like a registration form or a login. To understand how a backend works, you must learn about HTTP, which is a system of requests and responses. HTTP is how the frontend and the backend (your client computer and the server computer) communicate.

- The system that routes all these requests into the backend on the server computer, is called a web server. A webserver acts like a gate on the server, controlling all the requests which are going through. Apache and NginX are examples for a webserver.

- Next we need a system that can store data in an organized manner, and fetch it when the backend asks for it. This is the function of the database. A commonly used database management system is MySQL.

- Finally, we have the backend itself, which is the code that actually performs what you need to do. This can be written in a whole variety of programming languages eg: NodeJS,PHP,Flask. **We don’t allow MVC frameworks, like Django, Ruby on Rails, or Laravel.**

**Some resources for backend are listed below:**

- [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-ubuntu-18-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-ubuntu-18-04) - Tutorial on setting up Apache, PHP, and MySQL on Ubuntu. DigitalOcean tutorials are pretty good in general.
- [https://phptherightway.com/](https://phptherightway.com/) - A nice PHP reference
- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK_JCtrrv-c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK_JCtrrv-c) - A good intro to PHP (mostly covers all the important concepts)
- [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs) - Express/Node tutorial from MDN
- [https://youtu.be/9FBDda0NCwo](https://youtu.be/9FBDda0NCwo) - A video series on Flask for backend
- Once we start working with backend, **your mentors can recommend more resources based on what you need.**
