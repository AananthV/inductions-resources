Hi all!  
We recommend that you start using **Linux** soon.

**TL;DR**  
Use Linux, be happy.

## What is Linux?

- Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system.

## Why Linux?

- There are some great tools such as git, virtualenv, and package managers that are useful to developers, and are harder to work with on Windows. It is also relatively easy to set up and configure web servers.
Don’t worry if these terms seem alien, you’ll learn a lot this summer. You will find that when using the command line, you can get stuff done a lot faster, and you’ll also be able to automate a lot of things that you keep doing over and over again. Linux gives you a lot of power, and that saves your time. It makes it very easy to install software.

- Installing Linux is optional though, and you can use Windows, macOS, or any other functional OS. If you’ve got macOS, you can surely continue with that as that is also very much compatible with the tools mentioned. Using Linux for other users is highly recommended.

- We feel the earlier you start using it, the better, as once the tasks are released, and inductions are in full force, you will be learning more about the task itself. And when you are trying to do the task, your familiarity with Linux will surely help.

We totally understand that many of you may not have used, or even heard of Linux. So we’ve made a small collection of resources to get you started. You can find that here:
